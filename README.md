# mdm-oc

IBM Cloud Doc public cloud documentation repository for mdm-oc (Master Data Management service on IBM Cloud Pak for Data as a Service).

This repo and the IBM Cloud version of these docs **only contain the required IBM Cloud topics** (getting started, IAM, Activity Tracker, security topics, etc). Most of the non-required user doc topics are now kept in the CPDaaS doc app.

The CPDaaS doc app is:
 - Sourced in the https://github.ibm.com/watson-studio/wsdocs repository.
 - Maintained using Jekyll and Visual Studio Code.
 
See the Master Data Management service docs in the CPDaaS doc app here: https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/docs/content/wsj/mdm/getting-started.html
